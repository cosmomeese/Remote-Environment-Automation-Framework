/******************** sleep

Purpose: This function is called by the main loop and is used to sleep
the cpu in power down mode. The tranciever oscilator remains on so that
the board is still able to receive messages. The processor is woken when
the transceiver receives a message.

/*****************safeDelay

This delay function is to be used by developers when
needing to delay in their custom functions to allow the cpu to
be interrupted every half second to to check for new RF messages
and allow acknowledgements to be sent in a timely manner.
This function should be used when TASK is defined instead of the
standard arduino delay() command.

Parameter: wait, the length of the delay in milliseconds

/********* TC2 overflow IRQ service routine

This interupt service routine is used in monitoring applications when
TIME_SLEEP is defined, which uses timeSleep(), and the cpu is woken from sleep by the 
timer. This function disables sleep so that the peripherals continues through the main
loop before returning to sleep.

This ISR is also used when TASK is defined and safeDelay() is used to allow
for the cpu to be interrupted during long running tasks to handle wireless
packets. That is why receivePacket() is called within this function to send
any acknowledgements even if the cpu is in the middle of another task

/******* timerSleep

This function is called from the main function instead of sleep()
when TIME_SLEEP is defined. This function is woken by either receiving
a message on the transceiver or when the TC2 timer expires. When the timer
expires the ISR runs. This is used for peripherals that need to monitor
inputs periodically without being told to do so by the base station.
